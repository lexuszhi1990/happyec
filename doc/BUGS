# BUG #2: case insensitive
if "HH" is already registered, you can login with "hH" or "hh" or "Hh"
but people can still register with "hH""hh""Hh"
so now the issue is:
if I register as Name:"abc", Password"111"
I can log in with Name:"aBc", password"111"
this is actually nice.
But problem is, when I rigister another acount: Name"aBc", password"111"
then try to login, and I'll end up login as "abc", so this is a BUG.
FIX: it should be allowed to register as "aBc", when "abc" or "Abc", and things like that already register
that is make 

  validates_uniqueness_of :name, :email  

case insensitive

# BUG #1: trailing space when user register their name
when user rigister as "abc", he can still rigister as " abc" or "abc ", so this is a bug
but when trying to login as " abc" or "abc "(passwd supposed to be the same for all), they end up logining in as "abc"
this is actully acceptable or nice.
