# BUG: trailing space when user register their name
if "HH" is already registered, you can login with "hH" or "hh" or "Hh"
but people can still register with "hH""hh""Hh", or even worse "HH<space>"
FIXME.

# railscast #204 give a clear explan to "h" "raw" and "html_safe"

when you use "raw", don't write "< br>", the < and > will be escaped, write "<br>" ( no space!!)

# qq login 3 steps

http://connect.opensns.qq.com/

## STEP1: get access_token

https://graph.qq.com/oauth2.0/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=100240376&redirect_uri=http://ec.happypeter.org/auth/qq/callback

now the error:

    No route matches "/auth/qq/callback"

so I add in route.rb

  match "/auth/:provider/callback" => "users#login_with_qq"

then I get:
http://ec.happypeter.org/auth/qq/callback?code=844F8D4399626474034CAB441C379A89
//code=xxx, xxx is Authorization Code

Unknown action

The action 'login_with_qq' could not be found for UsersController


now I 

https://graph.qq.com/oauth2.0/token?grant_type=authorization_code&client_id=100240376&client_secret=07e7230147cbab07661c0232eda07657&code=28FF47651FE206C3AB973DD1C62849B1&state=1234&redirect_uri=http://ec.happypeter.org/auth/qq/callback

TIP: client_id=xxx NOT client_id =xxx

not i get in the page:

access_token=186D73F9A3F462D22FEC6028C638E0DD&expires_in=7776000

# STEP2: get openid with access_token

https://graph.qq.com/oauth2.0/me?access_token=186D73F9A3F462D22FEC6028C638E0DD

which returns:
callback( {"client_id":"100240376","openid":"B8B8CF6AB35A92FBF796615A74063BD6"} ); 

# STEP3: pull user info with your openid and things

https://graph.qq.com/user/get_user_info?access_token=186D73F9A3F462D22FEC6028C638E0DD&oauth_consumer_key=100240376&openid=B8B8CF6AB35A92FBF796615A74063BD6

then I get everything
{ "ret":0, "msg":"", "nickname":"王广忠", "figureurl":"http://qzapp.qlogo.cn/qzapp/100240376/B8B8CF6AB35A92FBF796615A74063BD6/30", "figureurl_1":"http://qzapp.qlogo.cn/qzapp/100240376/B8B8CF6AB35A92FBF796615A74063BD6/50", "figureurl_2":"http://qzapp.qlogo.cn/qzapp/100240376/B8B8CF6AB35A92FBF796615A74063BD6/100", "gender":"男", "vip":"0", "level":"0"

# migrate to linode
since I have happycasts already done here, so I do not need to do passenger again, but still I encounter a "readline" not found error, the fix was already documented. jsut install -dev package, do a ruby extend.conf or sth. so this is easy.
