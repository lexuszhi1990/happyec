## chatroom

I need a chatroom on the frontpage, even anonymous users can post

## Style
http://wufoo.com/tour/integration/

## structure

### users
we should stress on each person's ownership of everthing they put on the site.
Everything he's done, can be viewable on users#show, and users#index

### EcNews
the fontpage will have ECnews: everything happened on this site
will be noticed here, that is people do not need rss to check site update.
Like, some user post a article, or leave a comment, everything.

AND right here at ECnews, the site admins shall be able to post things like:
(I changed my mind: the "important Notice" is just a simple post, anybody can
post, not just admin, it special just in that it's topic is"Important
Notice:xxx", nothing special on the code level)

    important Notice: tommorrow's meeting canceled.

but it is just part of ECnews, I went open another place for it.

### events

the key component is events(meetings and others). There are two kinds,
upcoming and past. People can leave comments on Both. People own their own
comments here, but nobody own the event.


# idea for the offline

sure we can steal some from Blug and Toastmaster

1. same steps for each event, so that we can document it, and let the best
   idea bubble to the top, and remove bad ones. like Toastmaster.
2. we can try to play a short episode in a movie
3. give prepared speeches.
4. accept donation
